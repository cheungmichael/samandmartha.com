It didn&#8217;t quite go to plan with Martha being poorly (can&#8217;t really plan for that!) but all&#8217;s well that ends well and she&#8217;s fine now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It was hot in Hong Kong. I loved Disneyland because we went on lots of rides. These were the rides we went on:<br>&#8211; Parachute drop<br>&#8211; Teacups<br>&#8211; Mine cart<br>&#8211; Carousel<br>&#8211; Flying Saucers<br>&#8211; Journey to Halloween Town<br>&#8211; Dumbo<br>&#8211; Slinky<br>&#8211; Hyperspace Mountain<br>&#8211; Iron Man Simulator<br> I also really liked the show \u201cLet\u2019s Get Wicked\u201d and my favourite villain was Cruella De Ville. I bought a bubble machine in the shape of Mickey Mouse.<\/p><cite>Martha<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We only spent one afternoon in China instead of two weeks, but our visa does last for 2 years so in theory we could return! And despite the current political issues, they didn&#8217;t affect us too much in stopping us exploring and enjoying Hong Kong. We just had to adjust and plan and be flexible when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enjoyed being at our Causeway Bay flat on Hong Kong Island and would love to go back there, but hopefully when protest marches are not going past our block!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also good staying in Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon as we were close to all the shops and eateries that we needed, as well as having the MTR station on our doorstep so we could get pretty much anywhere. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, towards the end of our stay it got a little bit frustrating as the protests were consistently occurring on the next street so we just had to make sure that we got back in the afternoon and before the MTR station got closed down. We just hope that the people and the government can listen to each other and see a way through the current troubles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing my parents from the UK and meeting my Hong Kong family were the highlights; and my cousin David wins the Hong Kong star for looking after us, taking us places, and going beyond the call of duty by giving the kids a piggyback down some steep steps in the park in China!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s time to say goodbye to Hong Kong.
