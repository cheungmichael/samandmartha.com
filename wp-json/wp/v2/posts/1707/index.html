It was lovely being back in New Zealand, I enjoyed it all (except possibly those dracula sandflies on the west coast, but they loved me!). It was great that the kids were able to make new friends at each holiday park &#8211; they were off on the trampolines, and playing games with new friends before we&#8217;d even unpacked at some places. I was able to catch up with my old friend Rhiannon at the start and the end of the NZ trip which was fantastic.<\/p><p>My favourite new place was Hokitika &#8211; we saw a driftwood sculpture competition on the beach, there were some amazing entries, plus we bought Jack London&#8217;s White Fang for only 33 cents at the local op shop (charity shop) &#8211; bargain!<\/p><cite>Angela<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I enjoyed the scenery. New Zealand is beautiful. We did some lovely walks and had some amazing views, ones that I won&#8217;t forget. I like the open space and the lack of people.
